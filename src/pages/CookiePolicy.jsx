        <p>
          In addition to Section B.§ 6(1) of our Privacy Policy, this Cookie Policy explains how
          Khraish & Raja UG (limited liability) ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar
          technologies to recognize you when you visit our websites or apps. Here, we explain what
          these technologies are, why we use them, and your rights to control our use of them.
        </p>

        <p>
          In some cases, we may use cookies to collect personal data, or data that becomes personal
          if we combine it with other information. Please also refer to our Privacy Policy for more
          information about how we protect your personal data and your rights. There you will also

        <h2>What are Cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device when you
          visit a website. Website owners often use cookies to make their websites work or work more
          efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Khraish & Raja UG (limited liability)) are
          called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are
          called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or
          functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive
          content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your
          computer both when it visits the website in question and when it visits certain other
          websites.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          We use both first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are
          required for technical reasons in order for our websites to operate, and we refer to these
          as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies help us track the interests
          of our users and provide targeted content to enhance your experience on our online
          platforms. Third parties may set cookies through our websites for advertising, analytics,
          and other purposes. These are described in more detail below.
        </p>

        <h2>How Can I Manage Cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your
          cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie
          Consent Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject.
          Essential cookies cannot be rejected, as they are strictly necessary to provide you with
          services.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Cookie Consent Manager is available in the notification banner and on our websites. If
          you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our websites, though your access to some
          features and areas may be limited. You can also change your browser settings to accept or
          reject cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specific types of first- and third-party cookies used through our websites and the
          purposes they serve are described in the table below (please note that the specific
          cookies used may vary depending on the online platform you visit):
        </p>

        <h2>Categories of Cookies We Use</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies:</strong> These cookies are essential for the operation

          filling in forms. No consent is required for these cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Functional Cookies:</strong> These cookies allow the website to remember choices
          you make and provide enhanced, more personalized features. They only collect anonymized
          information and do not track your browsing on other websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Performance Cookies:</strong> These cookies collect information about how you use
          our website, such as which pages you visit most often and if you get error messages from
          web pages. All information collected by these cookies is aggregated and therefore
          anonymous. Disabling these cookies may limit the functionality of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Marketing / Third-Party / Consent-Based Cookies:</strong> These cookies are set by

          cookies at any time using the Cookie Consent Manager.
        </p>

        <h3>Essential Website Cookies (Technical Cookies)</h3>
        <p>
          These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our
          websites and to use some of their features, such as access to secure areas.
        </p>

        <h3>Performance and Functionality Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our websites but
          are not essential for their use. However, without these cookies, certain functions (such
          as videos) may become unavailable.
        </p>

        <h3>Analytics and Customization Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us
          understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are,
          or to help us customize our websites for you.
        </p>

        <h3>Advertising Cookies (Targeting Cookies)</h3>
        <p>
          These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They prevent the
          same ad from continuously reappearing, ensure that ads are displayed correctly for
          advertisers, and in some cases select advertisements based on your interests.
        </p>

        <h3>Social Media Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting
          on our websites through social networks and other third-party websites. These cookies may
          also be used for advertising purposes.
        </p>

        <h3>Unclassified Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          These are cookies that have not yet been classified. We are in the process of classifying
          these cookies with the help of their providers.
        </p>

        <h2>How can I manage cookies in my browser?</h2>
        <p>
          Because the ways to reject cookies through your web browser settings vary from browser to
          browser, you should consult your browser's help menu for more information. Below you will
          find information on how to manage cookies in the most common browsers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Chrome</li>
          <li>Internet Explorer</li>
          <li>Firefox</li>
          <li>Safari</li>
          <li>Edge</li>
          <li>Opera</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Most advertising networks also offer you the option to opt out of targeted advertising.

          <li>European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What about other tracking technologies like web beacons?</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use
          other, similar technologies from time to time, such as web beacons (sometimes called
          "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique
          identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our websites or opened an
          email that includes them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the movement patterns of
          users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies,
          to understand whether you have come to our website from an online advertisement on a
          third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email
          marketing campaigns. In many cases, these technologies rely on cookies to function
          properly, so declining cookies may impair their functioning.
        </p>

        <h2>How often will this Cookie Policy be updated?</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect, for example, changes to the
          cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore
          revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related
          technologies.
        </p>
        <p>This Cookie Policy was last updated in February 2025.</p>
