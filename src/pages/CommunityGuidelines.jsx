        <p>
          Welcome to the SAWA community! Our mission is to connect travelers with local hosts for
          authentic and meaningful experiences. To ensure a safe, respectful, and positive
          environment for everyone, we ask all members—both travelers and hosts—to adhere to these
          guidelines.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Be Respectful and Inclusive</h2>
        <p>
          Our community is global and diverse. Treat everyone with respect, regardless of their
          background, culture, religion, orientation, or identity. We have a zero-tolerance policy
          for discrimination, hate speech, and harassment of any kind.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Communicate Honestly and Clearly</h2>
        <p>
          Clear communication is key to a great experience. Be honest in your listings, profiles,
          and messages. Set clear expectations and be responsive to inquiries.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Prioritize Safety</h2>
        <p>
          Your safety is our top priority. Do not share sensitive personal information like your
          exact address or financial details until a booking is confirmed. Follow local laws and be
          mindful of your surroundings.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Keep it on SAWA</h2>
        <p>
          To protect your payment and personal information, keep all communication and payments
          within the SAWA platform until a booking is confirmed. This helps us support you if any
          issues arise.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Leave Honest Reviews</h2>
        <p>
          Your feedback helps our community grow and improve. Leave honest, fair, and factual
          reviews after your experience. Reviews should focus on the experience and not include
          personal insults or sensitive information.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Fulfill Your Commitments</h2>
        <p>
          As a host, honor your confirmed bookings. As a traveler, respect the host's rules and
          property. Cancellations can be disruptive, so please be considerate of the other party's
          plans.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Report Concerns</h2>
        <p>
          If you encounter anyone who violates these guidelines or makes you feel unsafe, please
          report it to our support team immediately. We will investigate all reports and take
          appropriate action.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thank you for being part of the SAWA community and helping us build a world of authentic
          travel connections.
